Define the ToDo and Activity classes so that the following C++ code is correct and its results are the ones indicated in the comments. Provide specification for the reversePrint() method.  

void ToDoList()
{
 ToDo<Activity> todo{};
 Activity tiff{ "go to TIFF movie", "20:00" };
 todo += tiff;
 Activity project{ "present project assignment", "09.20" };
 todo += project;

 // iterates through the activities and prints them as follows:
 // Activity present project assignment will take place at 09.20.
 // Activity go to TIFF movie will take place at 20.00.
 for (auto a : todo)				
  std::cout << a << '\n';

 // Prints the activities as follows:
 // Activity go to TIFF movie will take place at 20.00.
 // Activity present project assignment will take place at 09.20.
 todo.reversePrint(std::cout);
}
